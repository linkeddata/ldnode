/**
 * https://medium.com/trabe/synchronize-cache-updates-in-node-js-with-a-mutex-d5b395457138
 *  There are some npm libraries that implement some kind of mutex support (lock, mutex, async-lock) but none of them feel as simple and elegant as Valeriâ€™s code.
 *   His solution (pasted below with original comments):
 *
 *   Uses a boolean to keep the locked/unlocked state of the mutex.
 *   Uses promises to wait for the release of the lock.
 *   Relies on an event emitter to notify the code that is waiting when the lock is released.
